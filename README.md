What is Dimensional Model?
A dimensional model is a data structure technique optimized for Data warehousing tools. The concept of Dimensional Modelling was developed by Ralph Kimball and is comprised of "fact" and "dimension" tables.

A Dimensional model is designed to read, summarize, analyze numeric information like values, balances, counts, weights, etc. in a data warehouse. In contrast, relation models are optimized for addition, updating and deletion of data in a real-time Online Transaction System.

These dimensional and relational models have their unique way of data storage that has specific advantages.

For instance, in the relational mode, normalization and ER models reduce redundancy in data. On the contrary, dimensional model arranges data in such a way that it is easier to retrieve information and generate reports.

Hence, Dimensional models are used in data warehouse systems and not a good fit for relational systems.
